# Introduction and Welcome

## Welcome to Data Science: Linear Regression!

### Welcome to Data Science: Linear Regression!

Welcome to *Data Science: Linear Regression!* We're excited to have you join us in this course, which is designed to teach you about linear regression, one of the most common statistical modeling approaches used in data science.

This is the seventh course in the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science, a series of courses that prepare you to do data analysis in R, from simple computations to machine learning. We assume that you have either taken the preceding courses in the series or that you are already familiar with the content covered in them.

Linear regression is commonly used to quantify the relationship between two or more variables. It is also used to adjust for confounding. In this course, we cover how to implement linear regression and adjust for confounding in practice using R.

In data science applications, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables. The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in the book (and movie) Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs and to do this we'll use linear regression. 

We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process, and it is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use. You will learn when to use it in this course. 

The class notes for this course series can be found in Professor Irizarry's freely available Introduction to Data Science book.

**In this course, you will learn:**

How linear regression was originally developed by Galton
What confounding is and how to detect it
How to examine the relationships between variables by implementing linear regression in R

#### Course overview

There are three major sections in this course: introduction to linear regression, linear models, and confounding.

**Introduction to Linear Regression**

In this section, you'll learn the basics of linear regression through this course's motivating example, the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams. You'll also learn about correlation, the correlation coefficient, stratification, and the variance explained.

**Linear Models**

In this section, you'll learn about linear models. You'll learn about least squares estimates, multivariate regression, and several useful features of R, such as *tibbles, lm, do, and broom*. You'll learn how to apply regression to baseball to build a better offensive metric.

**Confounding**

In the final section of the course, you'll learn about confounding and several reasons that correlation is not the same as causation, such as spurious correlation, outliers, reversing cause and effect, and confounders. You'll also learn about Simpson's Paradox.
