# Set knitr options for knitting code into the report:
# - echo=TRUE: print out code (echo), though any results/output would still be displayed
# - cache=TRUE: Save results so that code blocks aren't re-run unless code changes (cache),
# _or_ a relevant earlier code block changed (autodep), but don't re-run if the
# only thing that changed was the comments (cache.comments)
# - message, warning = FALSE: Don't clutter R output with messages or warnings
# This _will_ leave error messages showing up in the knitted report
# - results="hide": hide the results/output (but here the code would still be displayed)
# - include=FALSE:  chunk is evaluated, but neither the code nor its output is displayed
# - eval=FALSE: chunk is not evaluated
